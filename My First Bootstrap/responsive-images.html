					Hol' on
Let's talk sex, we need more time
I guarantee you gonna feel all nice
I never knew you could do it like that
Like two peas in a pod, that's right
Counting all of my blessings
See I get you for my life, dey make me thank God
From the day you came into my life
Make our love no go, baby please baby, oh whoa
You know I'll be one call away
You got me too on, I want some
You got to be burning up, up
Take it all
I wanna hear you say my name
I say, oh, you've been on my mind like all day long.
